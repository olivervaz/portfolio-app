                Our company is technical partner for many clients, we help people to pass the path from idea to huge working projects.
                And I write on beautiful and mysterious Javascript and his brother Typescript.
                <br/>
                I mainly work with
                <abbr title="React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Meta.">React</abbr>
                and its ecosystem, but also I had broad experience in
                <abbr title="Vue.js is an open-source MVVM JavaScript framework for building user interfaces">Vue</abbr>
                and <abbr title="Angular is a TypeScript-based, open-source framework led by Google">Angular</abbr>.
                <br/>
                As someone said React Native contains word "React" and you know React - so you know React Native üíÅ.
                So I followed this logic and helped to build a couple of apps with <abbr
                    title="React Native is an open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms">React
                Native</abbr> üß±. First app was for PADI Travel and mvp app now.
