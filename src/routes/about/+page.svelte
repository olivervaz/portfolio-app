                for the past three years.
                .
                Our company serves as a technical partner to numerous clients, guiding them along the transformative
                journey from abstract ideas to robust, fully functional projects.
                And I specialize in the JavaScript and its noble sibling, TypeScript.
                <br/>
                I mainly work with
                <abbr title="React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Meta.">React</abbr>
                and its vast ecosystem, although I also possess extensive experience in
                <abbr title="Vue.js is an open-source MVVM JavaScript framework for building user interfaces">Vue</abbr>
                and <abbr title="Angular is a TypeScript-based, open-source framework led by Google">Angular</abbr>.
                <br/>
                As the saying goes, React Native shares the word "React," so those familiar with React inherently grasp
                the essence of React Native üíÅ.
                <br/>
                Thus, I followed this logical path and contributed to the development of a couple of robust <abbr
                    title="React Native is an open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms">React
                Native</abbr> applications üß±.
                The first app I worked on was for
                <Link
                        href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1497105546?mt=8"

                , and I am currently buiding another commercial app from scratch.
                <br/>
                I also trying to keep up with
